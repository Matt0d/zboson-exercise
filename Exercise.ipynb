That's a lot of action!\n\nThe maximum energy of these collisions is 14 TeV. However in most cases the collision energy is smaller than that because when protons collide it is really their constitiuents, the quarks and gluons, which collide with each other. So not all of the energy of the protons is transmitted to the collision.\n\nWhen the protons collide the energy of the collision can be transformed into mass ($E=mc^2$) and new particles are produced in the collisions.

Interesting particles are often short-lived and <b> decay </b> essentially at the interaction point so never reach the detectors. These processes can be searched for via their long-lived decay products, this is indirect detection.\n\nFor example the Z boson (the particle that mediates weak interaction) can't be detected directly with the CMS since the lifetime of the Z is very short. That means that the Z boson will decay before it even reaches the silicon detector of the CMS.\n\nHow it is possible to detect the Z boson then? A solution to this question comes from the decay process of the Z boson. If particles that originate from the decay of the Z are possible to detect, it is also possible to deduce the existence of the Z. So the detection is indirect.\n\nThe Z boson can decay in many ways (24 in fact) and in this exercise we will look at one of these: the decay of the Z to a muon ($\\mu^-$) and an antimuon ($\\mu^+$).

### Question 2 -->"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 5 :  Calculating the invariant mass"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have seen that the invariant mass can be used to identify partciles. \nNow let's calculate the invariant mass of the muon pairs for ourselves.\n \n#### Equation for invariant mass\n\nFirst, we derive loosely the equation for the invariant mass.\n\nLet's assume we have a particle with mass $M$ and energy $E$ which decays to two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and energies $E_1$ and $E_2$. \n\nEnergy $E$ and momentum $\\vec{p}$ are conserved in the decay process so\n\n$E = E_1 +E_2$ and $\\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_1+ \\vec{p}_2$.\n\nParticles will obey the relativistic dispersion relation:\n\n$$\nMc^2 = \\sqrt{E^2 - c^2\\vec{p}^2}.\n$$\n\nAnd with the conservation of energy and momentum this can be shown as\n\n$$\nMc^2 = \\sqrt{(E_1+E_2)^2 - c^2(\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2})^2}\n$$\n<!--\n$$\n=\\sqrt{E_1^2+2E_1E_2+E_2^2 -c^2\\vec{p_1}^2-2c^2\\vec{p_1}\\cdot\\vec{p_2}-c^2\\vec{p_2}^2}\n$$\n$$\n=\\sqrt{2E_1E_2 - 2c^2 |\\vec{p_1}||\\vec{p_2}|\\cos(\\theta)+m_1^2c^4+m_2^2c^4}. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nThe relativistic dispersion relation can be brought to the following format\n\n$$\nM^2c^4 = E^2 - c^2\\vec{p}^2\n$$\n$$\nE = \\sqrt{c^2\\vec{p}^2 + M^2c^4},\n$$\n-->\nfrom where by setting $c = 1$ (very common in particle physics) \n\n$$\nM = \\sqrt{(E)^2 - (\\vec{p})^2} = \\sqrt{(E_1+E_2)^2 - (\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2})^2}, \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\n\nFor those that like maths, a fuller derivation of this can be found <a href=\"images/Invariant_mass.pdf\"> here </a>\n\n\n#### How to do this in python\n\nIn python, you only need to write a proper equation once - since the code executes the equation automatically for each row of the file.\n\nFor example if you would like to sum the electrical charges of two muons for each event and save results in a variable _charges_, it could be done with the following code:\n```\ncharges = ds.Q1 + ds.Q2\n```\n\nSo you have to tell in the code that Q1 and Q2 refer to values in the variable `ds`. This can be done by adding the variable name separated with a dot in front of the value that is wanted, as in the example above.\n\nRemember that you can use 'sqrt'  from the _numpy_ module that we named as _np_. You can get a square root with the function `np.sqrt()`.  Naturally inside the brackets there will be anything that is inside the square root or brackets in the equation too.\n\n__In the cell below write code__ that will calculate the invariant mass value for muon pairs in each collision event in the data file. \n\nYou need to use the muons energy and momentum and then use equation 2 to calculate the invariant mass of the parent particle:\n\n\nThe energy of each particle can be calculated from:\n$$\nE_1^2 = \\vec{p_1}^2 + m_{1}^2\n$$\n\nRemember that momentum is a vector so:\n$$\n\\vec{p_1}^2 = (p_1^x)^2 +  (p_1^y)^2 +  (p_1^z)^2 \n$$\n\nwhere $p_1^x$ is the $x$-component of the momentum of particle 1. \n\n\nSave the values calculated in a variable called `invariant_mass`.\n\nThere are some comments in the cell below to help you with the different steps.\nThere are also some hints - only use these if you are really stuck!\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<details>\n    <summary>Hint 1</summary>\n When you write different quantities of the equation to your code, remember to refer to the variable from where you want to get the quantities. \nFor example if you would need the quantity \"pt1\", write \"ds.pt1\" to the code.   \n  \n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Hint 2</summary>\n Use the equations above for each step, for example to calculate the momentum squared of muon1 :\n   <code> \n  p1_squared = (ds.px1)**2 + (ds.py1)**2 + (ds.pz1)**2\n   </code>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Hint 3</summary>\n To calulate the energy of muon1 :    \n    <code> \n        e1 = np.sqrt(p1_squared + (muMass**2))\n    </code>\n</details>\n"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":" \n# You need the Mass of the Muon to calculate the energy\nmuMass = 0.105658   \n\n\n\n# Momentum squared for the two individual muons\n\np1_squared = (ds.px1)**2 + (ds.py1)**2 + (ds.pz1)**2\np2_squared = (ds.px2)**2 + (ds.py2)**2 + (ds.pz2)**2\n\n# Energy of the two individual muons\n\nE1 = np.sqrt(p1_squared+(muMass**2))\nE2 = np.sqrt(p2_squared+(muMass**2))\n\n# Total Energy of the two muons \n\nE = E1+E2\n\n# Momentum squared of the muon pair vector (p1+p2) - remember to add the vectors before squaring\n\npx = ds.px1 + ds.px2\npy = ds.py1 + ds.py2\npz = ds.pz1 + ds.pz2\n\n# Invariant mass of the muon pair, save this in  vraiable called \"invariant_mass\"\ninvariant_mass = np.sqrt((E)**2 - px**2 - py**2 - pz**2)","execution_count":52,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, if you run the cell below, the code will print the first five mass values that are calculated and will tell if the calculation is correct.

As the Z boson is not stable and decays we can identify the Z boson by its decay to two leptons as above. Consequently the Higgs boson can end up decaying to 4 leptons. We can look at the final states electron-positron and electron-positron ($e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$), electron-positron and muon-antimuon ($e^+ e^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$) as well as $\\mu^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\n\n<figure>\n    <center> <img src=\"images/Feymann_Higgs.png\" alt=\"image missing\" style=\"height: 350px\" />\n   <figcaption>Image 9: Feymann diagrams for Higgs to 4-lepton decays</figcaption> </center>\n</figure>\n\nTo calculate the invariant mass of the Higgs we need to know the mass of the particles in the final state. There are three different mass configurations here so three different calculations. We could look at the invariant mass distribution of each diagram above and then add them together to get the final distribution. But because these are high energy collisions, the masses of the electron and muon are very small compared to the momentum of the particles: "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### $p >> m$"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" Therefore the mass contribution to the energy is negligible, so: \n\n$ E^2 = \\vec{p}^2 + m^2 \\approx \\vec{p}^2$\n \n Now we can add all the $e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$, $e^+ e^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $\\mu^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\n  data together as their only physical difference is their mass and we have set this to zero.

That means that the <b> resolution </b> of the invariant masses is worse with larger pseudorapidities.\n    \n    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$ , the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) is worse for muons with greater pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from image 21 on page 32 of the CMS paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf\n    \n    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity on the resolution is that the particles which enter the endcap of the detector (larger pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 8). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for particles that have larger pseudorapidities.\n</details>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Extension exercise 2 : Fitting a function to the Z mass histogram"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nTo get information about the mass and lifetime of the detected resonance, a function that describes the distribution of the invariant masses must be fitted to the values of the histogram.
