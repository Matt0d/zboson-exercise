In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field.
